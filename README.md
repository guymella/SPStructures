# SPStructures
Simple &amp; Powerful Data Structures

A set of lightweight, fast and usable c++ data structures. Easily extensible. Avoid Using STL structures to keep code size down.

Structures are polymorphic with strong interface seggragation. 

## priorities: 
1. Emphasis is on allowing coders to easily create thier own datastructures for cache and architecture optimization. 
2. Keeping compiled code small, for crossplatform/emscripton optimized code.
3. Speed. 
4. efficiency, allow coders to tweek the memory usage vs performace to fit thier needs.
